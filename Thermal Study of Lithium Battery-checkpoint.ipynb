    "<p> For those that don't know the internal resistance of a battery lessens as its temperature rises. For now we will ignore this. Resistance then is constant, our current will be prechosen, mass and specific heat capactiy will be constants as well. This gives us the only changing variables to be time and our temperature. Using an iterative solution we can loop over each second, solving for final temp and using our return from our previous iteration as our initial conditions. While it will create a quadratic order of growth we can nest the operation inside of another iteration to walk over the pre chosen currents thus returning us several data arrays that can be modeled.
